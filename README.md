## Build software app for AE400 camera on Isaac SDK

1. create a folder named 'issac' under ~/Downloads and untar the Isaac SDK into it
```
 $ mkdir -p ~/Downloads/isaac
 $ cd ~/Downloads
 $ tar Jxvpf isaac-sdk-2019.2-30e21124.tar.xz -C isaac
```

2. modify the path in the WORKSPACE under the stereo_ae400 folder.
```
 local_repository(
     name = "com_nvidia_isaac",
     path = "/home/xxx/Downloads/isaac", # Here to sepcify your Issac SDK location, e.g. ~/Downloads/issac, xxx is your username
 )
```

3. build the app under stereo_ae400 folder.
```
 $ cd ~/Downloads/stereo_ae400
 $ bazel build //app/ae400_camera
```
 note: make sure your host can access to Internet, or you will get build errors

4. IP address configuration

#### Camera side:

 The default setting of AE400 camear is _192.168.0.100_, however, you can assign new IP address to it via browser.

 Input URL http://192.168.0.100 to open AE400 configuration page, log in, write new IP address and save setting

 <img src="screenshot_ae400_online_configuration.png" width="400">

 note: Check your product manual to find login account and password, or contact [LIPS](https://www.lips-hci.com/contact) to get support

#### Host side:

 Configure the IP address for connecting AE400 by editing the network setting file
```
 $ vi config/network.json

 {
   "config": {
     "ip": "192.168.0.100"  <= it should match AE400 camera's IP address
   }
 }
```

 Then install the setting to your system
```
 $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/etc/LIPS/lib
 $ sudo cp config/network.json /usr/etc/LIPS/lib/
```

 note: AE400 software looks for setting in system path ``/usr/etc/LIPS/lib/network.json``. If file is missing, default IP address _192.168.0.100_ is applied.

5. run camera app by command-line.
```
 $ bazel run //app/ae400_camera
```

 note: make sure the host, AE400 camera, and the remote robot are at same network domain, so they can connect to each other.

6. Open a web brower, connect to http://localhost:3000

 From left panel, select ae400_camera checkbox to enable depth/color channels for streaming.

7. Enjoy!

## Deploy the app to remote robot (optional)
You can run the app on remote robot like Jetson Nano or TX2

#### Deploy the app to remote robot
 - Use below command on your host side.
```
 # deploy.sh --remote_user <username_on_robot>
              -p //app/ae400_camera:ae400_camera-pkg
              -d <jetpack42 | jetpack43>
              -h <robot_ip>
              -u <insatll_home_name_you_want>
```

 - For example:
```
 $ ./deploy.sh --remote_user lips -p //app/ae400_camera:ae400_camera-pkg -d jetpack42 -h 192.168.0.100 -u dt
```

#### Run the app remotely on robot

 - Use below commands on your host side:

 1. make sure you have an SSH key on your desktop machine.
```
 $ ssh-keygen
 $ ssh-copy-id <username_on_robot>@<robot_ip>
```
 note: use command ssh-copy-id to save your time typing password when loging in to robot by ssh.

 2. copy network.json to remote robot
```
 $ scp config/network.json <username_on_robot>@<robot_ip>:~/
```

 3. ssh log in to remote robot

 - install network setting
```
 $ ssh <username_on_robot>@<robot_ip>
 $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/etc/LIPS/lib
 $ vi ~/network.json   //optional, if you want to re-assign IP address for connection
 $ sudo cp ~/network.json /usr/etc/LIPS/lib/
```

 - run the app
```
 $ cd ~/deploy/<install_home_name_you_want>/ae400_camera-pkg
 $ ./app/ae400_camera/ae400_camera
```

 4. open a web brower, connect to http://*<robot_ip>:3000*

 5. from left panel, select ae400_camera checkbox to enable depth/color channels for streaming.
